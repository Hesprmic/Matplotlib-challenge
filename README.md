# Matplotlib-challenge
5th homework assignment

In this homework, we again used Jupyter Notebook to write code using our newly learned skills of graphing within pandas and the addition of matplotlib. We used the data of a lab experiment using mice to compare treatment of drugs and the effectiveness in reducing tumors. Variables for the mice included different sex, how long the treatment lasted, tumor size, and drugs regimen (main variables we used in our data). We combined earlier knowledge of pandas to combine .csv files and removed duplicated data. Next we used pandas to obtain statistical data on the drugs and their effectiveness on reducing tumor sizes. Lastly we used pandas and matplotlib to create various types of graphs to show specific outcomes of drugs, Capomulin in particular. After this homework I am more comfortable in creating graphs and showing correlations and regressions to highlight data more visually that just numbers in charts/dataframes.
